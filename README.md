# Travel-Map-Journals :flight_departure:
A web application for travel lovers who wants to save the places they've visited:
enter journal entry and upload pictures.

# Why I Built This :bulb:
I am really bad with directions and Google Maps is my co-pilot whenever I'm in the
driver's seat. I also had a goal of having a world map on a wall, placing a pin
and a picture/postcard to the places that I've visited. Therefore, I thought of
doing it in a digitized way hence coming up with this project.
